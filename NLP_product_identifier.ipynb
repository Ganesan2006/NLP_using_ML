(luckily for him, i didn't.) two things - it's a bit noisy, so be prepared for that, but you shouldn't be nervous or associate that with its level of gentleness. and i've found it works best if you use an up and down motion instead of the small circles recommended in the manual.i used to shave every day, which was time-consuming and annoying. i tried waxing, but it was messy and never really got all the hair off -- not to mention living with icky stubble for the hair to grow long enough to re-wax. but no more! i can now go hair-free for weeks. this emjoi is the best present i've ever gotten!\",\n",

       " \"i have to admit, i wasn't too thrilled when i first looked at this one. &quot;great, another silly space-war game&quot; i thought. but once we started playing, my opinion changed. the original risk is a classic, but even the old favorites can get a little stale after a while. this 23rd century version is still the classic &quot;conquer the world&quot; game, but with enough new twists to make it seem like a whole new game. the most obvious difference is the new look of the game board. continents have shifted around a bit, all the territory names have been updated (oh, how i miss kamchatka in the springtime...), and there are now underwater territories. there's also a second smaller gameboard representing moon-based territories. the roman numeral unit makers are now mods, little robotic looking battle drones of varying sizes. as for the gameplay, its the same basic deploy and attack, but now there are also special command units to work with. for example, you need to buy a naval commander if you want to attack underwater, and you can't get to the moon without both a space commander and a space station. lose either of those, and your lunar troops are cut off until you replace them. you also accumulate power points, which you can redeem for commanders, stations, special-function cards or to buy a specific place in the turn order. the cards are the best new feature of the game, adding alot of variety to the gameplay, and setting the stage for amazing shifts in the direction of the game. say your opponant has asia locked up, and you're really tired of him getting those extra 7 units each turn. if you've purchsed the nuke commander, you can use your power units to buy nuke cards. draw the right one, and you can nuke the whole continent, removing one of his units from *every territory*!. careful, though. nuke the wrong continent (determined by a die roll when you play the card) and you could nuke yourself! (ask ray, he knows!) another nice touch is the status board, a grid numbered 1 to 70. each player puts a unit on the board, in the box showing the number of territories owned. as battles are resolved, the winner's marker moves up and the loser's moves down, making it very easy to keep track of territory counts. &quot;risk 2210 a.d.&quot; has enough new features to draw a whole new set of fans, but is enough like the classic to satisfy the old-timers. overall, a worthy successor to an all-time classic.\",\n",
       " \"as soon as i bought this game, my friends and i played it twice. even if you are already familiar with risk, some of the new rules might be challenging to learn. however, the new rules generally make the game much more fun. for example, commanders are more effective at attacking, commander cards add new strategies for winning, and the oceans and even the moon can be your battleground.for people new at strategic war games, the new game might seem a little too complex, but the game contains rules for playing with the original &quot;classic&quot; risk rules, although with different-looking armies.if you're a fan of strategic war games, and especially a fan of risk, you will greatly enjoy this game.p.s. i gave this game 2 stars for educational value because it encourages strategic thinking but does not really teach anything aside from diplomatic skills. i gave this game 3 stars for durability because after playing the game twice, nothing broke, but all the pieces are plastic, so imo it's only a matter of time. also, the tray that holds the plastic pieces is made of a kind of paper-board, so it's not as durable as plastic or styrofoam (such as in &quot;shogun&quot;, a.k.a. &quot;samurai swords&quot;).\",\n",

       " 'mage knight is a collectible miniature figurine game. you play by using strategy and battle using math. it is a very challenging game and i wouldnt reccomend it to children 10 and under. of course some of the smaller figures are sensitive, so they can break when being held while clicking the base. the best part is buying a booster and having the surprise of getting a rare figure. some of the unique figures are worth quite alot of money so try and keep them in good condition. there are also tournaments where you battle other people and can win prizes.overall, mage knight is an awesome hobby and is extremely addictive.hans',\n",

(who ever would think a tub spa's remote would not handle a dunk in the water?) well i read the instructions carefully and the remote immediately needed to be dried off and the batteries taken out and dried and the whole thing needs time to dry. the next time i tried it (yes i was determined) i got the whole tub floor wet and pushed down on all 24 or so of those little suction cups and tried it again. still the same story. as i try to push down on the part of the mat coming up by my feet, the part by my head comes up. i end up having to lie there totally flat while the mat bubbles come up around me cooling my nice hot bath water. the hose pops off yet again and i go to use the remote (which is this time not in the precarious holder) and sick and tired of all the faults already i try to turn it off and the remote doesn't even work. this is not relaxing.\",\n",

       " \"just in time for halloween! when i grew up i had a whole army of masters of the universe. i watched the cartoon every afternoon. i loved it. skeletor was always my favorite. but now they have come out with a new cartoon and toy line. i have seen the cartoon and saw the toys in the store. some people say you can't beat the original, most times it's true, but this is one big exception. i love the show, is much more well written than the original, and skeletor is finally truely evil and fearful. this toy is definately another improvement. just look at skeletor's skull face. it's creepy. and the detail on him is excellent. his head and body are sized right. one problem with the originals is they used the same mold for almost every motu character. they just put a diffrent head and armor on, and the head was always too big and the armor cheap looking. skeletor's clothing is very detailed , it looks like real leather. his feet are bare and you can see the skin pattern all over his body.the original havoc staff was a molded plastic purple stick with a ram's head on. it kind of looked like a skull. but on the new one it's so real looking you can see the teeth and bones under the ram skull. the skull and horns are diffrent colors along with the staff itself. his sword is similar to the ones the original skeletor and he-man came with. it breaks in two also, but now skeletor has both, he-man has an all new power sword. the detail on them are great, too. this is my only complaint. the sword doesn't stay together easily, but i'm not too worried about it, i bought him to display not to play with. if you do decide to get skeletor i recommend getting panthor also. the two compliment each other. you won't be disappointed.\",\n",
